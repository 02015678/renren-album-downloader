1. Add an options page. Options:
   - Zip size: Cut down zip size if Chrome crashes when preparing zips
   	 - Range: 100KB - 2MB
   	 - Recommended: 1 ~ 1.4MB (below: yellow, within: green, over: red)
   - Scroll speed: Increase scroll speed if you hate waiting for the scroll. But remember that a high scroll speed might result in downloading incomplete albums. 
   - Use photo title as filename: Might make zips un-unzippable
     - Default: no
   - Use album name as folder name: Might make zips un-unzippable
     - Default: no
