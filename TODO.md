Chrome runs out of memory for large albums
----

Solutions: 

1. Make several zips

Make new zip per 5 pics? Or per 1.5 MB? 

Find the size threshold! 

Download multiple zips, and extract all to the current folder will do perfectly. 

2. Build a server side

Too much work. 

Encoding problem in linux
----

Problem: 

zip file would contain a "download_FILES" folder, which contains a correctly named folder (with album name) and a garble-named folder. All photos (also garble-named) are in the garble-named folder.
