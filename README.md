How to use
====

1. Go to a Renren album that you want. Not a album share page (yet). If you happen to be in a album share page, click on the link below the album name to the real album page. 
2. Click "Download album". 
3. Wait for the page to automatically scroll to the bottom, and the zips to download. If Chrome prompts about downloading multiple files, click "Allow". Do *NOT* leave the album page (e.g. click a link on the page) or close the tab until all downloads finish. Feel free to switch to other tabs, though. 
4. After all zips are on your disk, go to your default download folder, and extract all the zips to *one* folder (e.g. click "extract here"). Do *not* extract to seperate folders, that would make your life much harder. 
   * A side note: do not worry about mixing the new zips with the old ones, just extract all of them (again, to the same folder), and do not overwrite any existing files. Different albums will go to their respective folders. 
5. After extraction, you will find a folder named album<albumId>, inside of which all the photos are named with its index in the album. Also there is an info.txt, where you can find the real album name as well as titles for all the photos (if approapriate). You may rename the folder to the album name if you want to. 

I know making you download a bunch of meaninglessly-named zips containing meaninglessly-named album folders is far from perfect from a user experience standpoint, but I've tried my best. I will make it better when I am able to (when Chrome allow me to). 

Note: for those extra large photos (> maximum zip size), new tabs will be created, and you are welcomed to download them yourself. This rarely happens, though. :)

If things just don't work, try restarting Chrome. An extended session might induce weird problems. 

Known Problems
====

1. If album name (i.e. folder name) is too long, the zip files will be un-unzippable in Windows. Therefore the album name is currently limited to 20 characters. Longer names will be truncated. 

2. If album name is chinese, the name might be garbled in Ubuntu.
