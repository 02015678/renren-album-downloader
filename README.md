How to use
----

1. Go to a Renren album. 
2. Click "Download album". 
3. Wait for the zips to download. If Chrome prompts about downloading multiple files, click "Allow". 
4. After all zips are on your disk, go to your default download folder, and extract all the zips to *one* folder (e.g. click "extract here"). Do *not* extract to seperate folders, that would make your life much harder. 
5. After extraction, you will find a folder named album<album_id>, inside of which all the photos are named with its index in the album. Also there is an info.txt, where you can find the real album name as well as titles for all the photos (if they have any). You are free to rename the folder to the album name. 

I know making you download a bunch of zips is not perfect from a user experience standpoint, but I've tried my best. I will make it better when I am able to (when Chrome allow me to). 

Known Problems
----

1. If album name (i.e. folder name) is too long, the zip files will be un-unzippable in Windows. Therefore the album name is currently limited to 20 characters. Longer names will be truncated. 

2. If album name is chinese, the name might be garbled in Ubuntu.
